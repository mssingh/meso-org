# meso-org
A project investigating the relationships between the structure of precipitation on mesoscales and the large-scale atmospheric state.

The main ideas for this project are outlined in the Paper sketch pdf document. The overall idea is to relate properties of the mesoscale structure of precipitation to those of the large-scale atmosphere. To this end, we begin by creating two datasets. One that characterises the mesoscale preciptiation structure from IMERG satelite estimates of precipitation. The second characterises the large-scale state of the atmosphere from ERA5 reanalysis.

## Datasets

### IMERG preciptiation
Location:

`/g/data/k10/cb4968/metrics/observations/IMERG/small_domain/pr_based/IMERG/`

Example filename:

`pr_based_IMERG_3hrly_0-360_-30-30_3600x1800_2001-01_2023-12_boxsize_5_2001_1-2001_1.nc`


### ERA5 mesoscale averages

Location:

`/g/data/k10/cr7888/era5_daily_means_5deg/`
`/g/data/k10/cr7888/era5_daily_means_2deg/`

Example filename:

`u/era5_u_daily_mean_2deg_1990.nc`
